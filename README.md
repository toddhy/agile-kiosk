## 🚀 How to Run Locally

Because this prototype is built with standard web technologies (HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript), there are no complex build steps required:

1. Double-click [`index.html`](index.html) to open directly in any browser.
2. Or run a quick local server:
   ```powershell
   npx serve .
   # or
   python -m http.server 8080
   ```
   Then navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

3. **Display Modes**:
   - Use the **Fit Window / Portrait Kiosk** button in the top bar to toggle between the 9:16 vertical bezel framing (simulating a physical 43" kiosk) and full-window mode.
   - Use the **Fullscreen** button for kiosk demonstrations.
